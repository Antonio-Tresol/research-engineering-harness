"""STALE-001/002: the bookkeeping artefacts have kept up with the work.

Every other check verifies internal consistency: that a claim's evidence exists,
that statuses are legal, that numbers resolve. None of them notice when the
research tree simply stopped being updated. A project can run twenty experiments
against a placeholder `Q1` and pass everything.

    STALE-001  no bookkeeping artefact has changed while N commits ADDED or
               MODIFIED files under `results/`.  [warning]
    STALE-002  a document declares `updated:` in its frontmatter, and git shows
               the file changed after that date.  [warning]

Both use git, so both are silent outside a repository or before the first
commit. Both are warnings: only a person can say whether an experiment produced
a belief worth recording, and a gate that blocks on that judgement gets bypassed.

Configure:

    [staleness]
    watch = ["results"]                       # only results imply a finding
    artefacts = ["TREE.md", "RESEARCH_LOG.md"]  # either one clears the count
    max_commits_behind = 8
    dated_docs = ["reports/**/*.md"]          # enables STALE-002

Deliberately narrow. Counting every commit that touched `scripts/` treated
tooling syncs and refactors as evidence that experiments had run, and anchoring
only on TREE.md made the advice "note it in the log" impossible to satisfy.

    lanorme check . --check=staleness
