"""Operations layer: the write commands that record new content in the research record.

Every write follows one contract, implemented once in `write_transaction` and reused
by all of them: take a snapshot of the files about to change, apply the edit, run the
project's validator as a separate process, and then either keep the change or put the
files back exactly as they were. The markdown files are the database, so a write that
would leave the record invalid never survives on disk. Each command also accepts
`dry_run`, which prints the lines it would write and touches nothing.
