"""Layer 3 (operations): read-only integrity checks over the research graph.

Provenance pinning, drift detection against a pinned evidence hash, orphan
documents, and a combined ``verify`` report all live here. Every function
reads the record through ``research_graph_model`` and returns data or a
findings list; nothing in this module writes to TREE.md, RESEARCH_LOG.md,
or notes/ — that is ``research_graph_write.py``'s job.

Findings are plain sentences, one problem each, prefixed by severity so a
reader (human or agent) can tell at a glance what needs action: ERROR for
something that must be fixed before the record can be trusted, WARNING
for something worth a look but not blocking, INFO for a fact worth
knowing. These three prefixes and the OK/INVALID exit codes come from
``research_graph_model``, the module's one shared home for both
conventions; ``verify`` uses the same ERROR prefix to decide its exit
code, so the prefix on a line is never just decoration.
