"""Interfaces layer: the command-line entry point agents and humans use to
navigate, verify, and extend the research record as a typed graph.

Presentation only: every handler calls research_graph_model (domain model and
loader), research_graph_checks (read-only checks), or research_graph_write
(validated writes), then formats the result. Every command is declared once
in COMMAND_REGISTRY — name, one-sentence help, arguments, handler — and both
argparse's subparsers and the agent-facing `help` command are generated from
it, so the documented commands and the runnable commands can never drift
apart.

Run: uv run scripts/research_graph.py <command>. For an agent-oriented guide
assuming no prior context, run: uv run scripts/research_graph.py help"""
